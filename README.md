# Code Refactor

## Description

A common task for developers is to take existing code and refactor it (improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. This project simulates being hired by a hypothetical marketing agency to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I was given starter code with the task of refactoring it. This was an essential project for me as it gave me more knowledge and experience with HTML and CSS code as well as learning best practices.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency <br />
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards <br />
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines <br />

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards <br />
WHEN I view the source code <br />
THEN I find semantic HTML elements <br />
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements <br />
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br />
WHEN I view the image elements <br />
THEN I find accessible alt attributes <br />
WHEN I view the heading attributes <br />
THEN they fall in sequential order <br />
WHEN I view the title element <br />
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title <br />

## Installation

The only thing needed for this project is an environment to write HTML and CSS code such as VS code.

## Usage

As this project is mainly about refactoring code, the usage piece is not as important. The main idea is to view the HTML and CSS code to see clean code and best practices.
